/-- Conjugation fails the Cauchy-Riemann equations. -/

  Axiom.mk "conjugationFailsCR" (Formula.pred 0 [])
    "f(z) = z̄ satisfies ∂u/∂x = 1 �?-1 = ∂v/∂y, so it fails Cauchy-Riemann"

/-- Anti-holomorphic: z̄ is differentiable w.r.t. z̄ but not z. -/
def conjugationIsAntiholomorphic : Axiom :=
  Axiom.mk "conjugationIsAntiholomorphic" (Formula.pred 0 [])
    "z �?z̄ is anti-holomorphic: ∂f/∂z = 0 but ∂f/∂z̄ = 1"

/-! ## |z|² is NOT Holomorphic -/

/-- The squared modulus function f(z) = |z|² is not holomorphic except at 0. -/
def squaredModulus (z : �? : �?:=
  { real := ComplexNumbers.modulus z * ComplexNumbers.modulus z, imag := 0 }

    "f(z) = |z|² = z * z̄ is not complex-differentiable anywhere (except at 0); ∂f/∂z̄ = z �?0"

/-- In any neighborhood of 0, exp(1/z) takes every nonzero complex value. -/
def expOneOverzEssential : Axiom :=
  Axiom.mk "expOneOverzEssential" (Formula.pred 0 [])
    "f(z) = exp(1/z) has an essential singularity at 0; image of any punctured nbhd is ℂ\\{0}"

/-! ## log z Requires a Branch Cut -/

/-- The complex logarithm cannot be defined as a holomorphic function on ℂ\{0}
    because of the monodromy around the origin. -/
def logCannotBeEntire : Axiom :=
  Axiom.mk "logCannotBeEntire" (Formula.pred 0 [])
    "There is no holomorphic branch of log z on ℂ\\{0}; the monodromy around 0 gives a 2πi jump"

/-- Any branch of log z on a simply connected domain avoiding 0 is holomorphic. -/
def logOnSimplyConnected : Axiom :=
  Axiom.mk "logOnSimplyConnected" (Formula.pred 0 [])
    "On any simply connected domain D �?ℂ\\{0}, a holomorphic branch of log z exists"
